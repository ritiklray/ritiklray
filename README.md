## 👋 About Me
I’m a UI/UX Designer focused on turning ideas into clean, usable digital products with strong user experience and interface design.

Alongside design, I work on front-end development and Flutter app development, using AI-assisted tools to speed up prototyping and ship ideas faster.

I have experience with AI tools for UI design and UX research, including wireframing, prototyping, usability analysis, and design exploration to support data-informed design decisions.

I care deeply about user-centered design, clean UI, accessibility, and practical problem-solving over over-complicated visuals.

Currently exploring product design, front-end engineering, Flutter development, and AI-powered design & development workflows.
