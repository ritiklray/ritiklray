## 👋 About Me
I’m a UI/UX Designer focused on creating clean, user-centered digital products with strong UX and UI principles.

Alongside design, I work on front-end and Flutter development, using AI-assisted workflows to prototype faster and build MVPs.

I have hands-on experience with AI tools for UI design and UX research, including wireframing, prototyping, and usability analysis to support better design decisions.

Currently exploring product design, front-end engineering, Flutter, and AI-powered design & development workflows.
